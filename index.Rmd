## Bio


Mohammad Sardar studies at the University of Toronto, double majoring in Statistics and Economics (The two greatest subjects to ever exist). He is also a member of Trinity College (widely known to be the best college at UofT). He is passionate about data and how it can be modified and analysed to be applied to the real world, and hopes that his work will be significant enough to bring a change to the world. He likes reading books and scrolling aimlessly through his phone to pass the time and procrastinate. He loves animals and working with animals and hopes to retire in a nice farm away from society. His coding skills are currently sub-par, but he is actively working on improving them and hopes to impress both the Professor and the TA with his work.
